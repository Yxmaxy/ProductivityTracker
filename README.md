# ProductivityTracker
<p>
Productivity tracker is an application that can help you keep track of your goals and reminders.<br/>
The main application consists of four tabs:
<ul>
<li><b>Today</b> - list of checks which should be done today. They are categorized into groups, that can be closed or opened for a better overview. Tasks can also contain subtasks</li>
<li><b>Month</b> - an overview of how successful the user was at completing daily tasks which is reflected in how green/red a certain day is</li>
<li><b>Longterm</b> - goals which do not have a set date to complete them</li>
<li><b>Reminders</b> - short-tearm goals that send a reminder to the user, when they should complete the task</li>
</ul>
<p>
When adding a goal, the user needs to set it's name, group and how frequently they want the goal to appear. For example, the frequency can be set to once per month, multiple times per week, once per year etc.
</p>
The application was made with the <a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo framework</a> in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.

The project was not entirely finished, but is nonetheless available for download on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.yxmaxy.productivityTracker">Google Play store</a>.
